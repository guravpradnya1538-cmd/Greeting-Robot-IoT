# Greeting Robot Using IoT

This project is designed to greet visitors with personalized messages using IoT-based control.  
The robot takes user-defined inputs such as guest name, type of event, and custom messages, and displays/play greetings automatically.

## Features
- Personalized greeting messages.
- IoT-based control using ESP8266.
- Motion-sensor-based activation (optional).
- LCD/LED display or audio output.

## Components Used
- NodeMCU / ESP8266
- LCD Display
- Jumper wires
- Power module

## How It Works
1. User uploads guest data via IoT (web/phone interface).
2. ESP8266 processes this data.
3. The robot greets when someone approaches.
4. Pre-programmed messages are displayed.

## Files Included
- main.ino (core code)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Embedded C
- IoT communication
- Sensor interfacing
- Real-time control
